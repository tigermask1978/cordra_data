Cordra can be configured to allow sending emails from Type Methods. In order to enable this, you will need to add the supporting jar libraries to your Cordra instance and then configure the emails you wish to send.For this example, we¡¯ll use the Simple Java Mail emailing library to send emails. The jar files needed are included in the Cordra distribution, in the extensions/user-registration/lib directory. To install this library, jar files into a directory called lib in your Cordra data directory. If the li
b directory doesn¡¯t exist, create the lib directory in the Cordra data directory.You will need to restart the Cordra server once the Java Mail Client library is installed if your Cordra server is already running.Create a file in the data directory called emailServerConfig.json with the following contents:Be sure to replace the example settings with the settings for your actual SMTP server. Finding these settings is outside of the scope of this document, but most email providers have some way of sending emai
ls using SMTP. You can also use Amazon¡¯s Simple Email Service for testing.In the data directory, create an emailTemplates directory. In that directory, create files called creation.txt and creation.html. These files should contain the text and html (respective) that should be sent in the email.As an example, we¡¯ll modify the beforeSchemaValidation method on the User object to send an email whenever a new User object is created. Replace the default User schema javascript with the following:Next, try creating
 a new User in Cordra. You should receive an email containing the message specified in the JavaScript configuration.The email templates are loaded from the files we created before (lines 24-25). Be sure to modify emailConfig with real email addresses to use for sending the email. Email server config is loaded from a local file in the loadServerConfig function (lines 47-50), so the secrets are never network accessible through Cordra.We are using context.isNew to make sure we only create a token on new object
 creation (line 10). The Java classes from Simple Mail Client are loaded into the JavaScript (lines 18-20) and then used using the Simple Java Mail API (lines 26-44).
