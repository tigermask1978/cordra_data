The Design object is a central location where much of the Cordra configuration is stored. For example, the configuration for the UI, authorization, and handle minting are all stored on the Design object. When logged in as a Cordra admin into the UI, the Design Object Admin menu item provides you a way to edit this object directly. The Design object could also be updated using a configuration file on startup; see repoInit.json.Here are the properties available in the Design object for fine-tuning Cordra beha

so be modified on startup by including a repoInit.json file in the Cordra data directory. The JSON structure under the design property in the repoInit.json file should match what is expected in the Design object. For example, to add ids that are useful for Authentication via Keys, you could include the following in the repoInit.json file:
