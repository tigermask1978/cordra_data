This document describes an approach that could be used to set up a single instance of Cordra for production.You will need to install Java 8+, Nginx, unzip, and certbot with the Nginx plugin.

Setting up such a domain is outside of the scope of this document.Finally, make sure ports 80, 443, 2641, and 9000 are publicly accessible through any firewall or security measures.Create an Nginx config file for cordra at /etc/nginx/sites-available/cordra. Replace cordra.example.org in the config file with your domain.:Enable the Cordra site and disable the default site:Enable HTTPS with a Let¡¯s Encrypt certificate.
