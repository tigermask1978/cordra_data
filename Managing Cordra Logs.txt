If Cordra is run within Tomcat, then Tomcat¡¯s default settings enable Tomcat to produce access logs. If Cordra is run as a standalone process, then Jetty is used for running Cordra. By default, Jetty does not produce access logs. The following sample configuration can be stored in data/jetty.xml for Jetty to produce access logs, where data is the Cordra¡¯s data directory:Cordra logs errors by default, and those entries are written to files that begin with error.log in the directory data/logs. One file per mo
nth will be produced, and the actual file name will reflect the year and month, e.g., error.log-201510, for the error log that corresponds to the entries for October 2015.It may be be useful to send the logged entries from access and error logs to an indexing service for retrieval and analysis. You may choose to use Elasticsearch as that indexing service. You will also need to install and configure two tools, Logstash and Filebeat to transform and register the logs with Elasticsearch.The following instructi
ons describe how to configure Logstash and Filebeat to register error logs with an Elasticsearch indexer that is running on port 9200 on localhost.Install Logstash using the instructions on the Logstash website.Use the logstash-plugin command to install the following plugins:logstash-input-beatslogstash-output-elasticsearchlogstash-filter-datelogstash-filter-groklogstash-filter-mutateCreate a file called cordra.conf in the Logstash configuration directory. Copy the following into that file:Be sure to edit t
