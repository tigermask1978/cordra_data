Collab is an open source prototype software extension to Cordra software that can be integrated into existing data management systems to augment those systems with a capability to allot digital object identifiers to data and answer certain questions that demonstrate the readiness of the data for use in science and decision-making. One of the core functionalities of the software is to demonstrate how to easily create, repeat, and reproduce complex scientific workflows.Collab is described in more detail at th
is website. High availability and scalability are not specifically addressed in this prototype software.The prototype software is made available in the Cordra download, in the extensions/collab directory.This project is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award Number 1838981. The two resulting research papers are made available here and here.
